Dear Carpentry attendee:

Thank you for registering for our UCSB Software Carpentry Workshop.  We are 
looking forward to spending time with you all.

There are several steps we would like you to take before the workshop. 

Most importantly, install all of the software that we will be using: git, Bash, and R.  There are
[detailed setup instuctions](https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/2019-02-21-UCSBLibrary/index.html#setup) 
on the workshop website.  Feel free to contact [Jon Jablonski](mailto:jonjab@ucsb.edu), [Yuan Wu](mailto:yuanwu@ucsb.edu), or [Sharon Solis](swsolis@ucsb.edu) if you need some help with installation.

Next, fill out this [pre-workshop survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/swc_pre_workshop_v1?workshop_id=2019-02-21-UCSBLibrary), which is also linked from the main workshop page.

Please also review the [Carpentry Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).  We are dedicated to creating a respectful and inclusive learning environment for everyone present.  
  
Coffee, tea, and a light breakfast will be served both mornings.  Lunch on 
Thursday will be sandwiches and salads.  Saturday we will have pizza and salad.  If you have any specific dietary restrictions, please e-mail 
[collaboratory@library.ucsb.edu](mailto:collaboratory@library.ucsb.edu) before 5:00pm Tuesday, February 19.

Breakfast will be available starting at 8:30.
If you have problems with software installation or configuration, please arrive promptly at
8:30 and the instructors and helpers will be able to assist you during breakfast.  This is
a hands-on workshop, so having your laptop ready is critical.

We will start promptly at 9:00 am each day.  

Finally: this is a sold out workshop and we have people on a waiting list.  Please contact ASAP if you
are unable to attend so that we can open up your seat to someone else.

We'll see you Thursday morning February 21!

- Your UCSB Carpentry Team
