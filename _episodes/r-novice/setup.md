        Install R by downloading and running
        <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm">this .exe file</a>
        from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>.
        Also, please install the
        <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio IDE</a>.
        Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the
        installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as
        administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later,
        for example when installing R packages.
